## ✅ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (IMPLEMENTED TODAY)

Added exact match keywords at A$15:
- [couples counselling newcastle]
- [couples counseling newcastle]
- [marriage counselling newcastle]
- [psychologist hamilton]

**Why:** These keywords have 10-15x ROI but were getting minimal impressions due to low bids.

---

### 2. HOUSEHOLD INCOME BID ADJUSTMENTS (Priority #1)

| 21-30% | -20% | Lower priority |
| 31-40% | -40% | Unlikely to convert |
| 41-50% | -50% | Very unlikely to convert |
| Lower 50% | -60% | Wrong audience |

**Expected Impact:** 40-50% improvement in conv. value/cost

---

### 3. AD SCHEDULE EXPANSION
**Status:** TO IMPLEMENT
