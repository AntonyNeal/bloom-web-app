## üö´ What to Avoid (Current Content Issues)

### Problematic Elements in Provided Content

1. **"Australia's Most Generous Psychology Practice"**
   - Too salesy, superlative-heavy
   - Doesn't match Bloom's humble tone
   - Better: "Fair Pay for Good Work" or "What You Earn, What You Keep"

2. **Multiple Exclamation Marks**
   - Current draft feels too enthusiastic/salesy
   - Bloom is calm and confident
   - Remove all unnecessary punctuation energy

3. **"Industry-leading"** / **"We believe you deserve more"**
   - Sounds like marketing copy, not authentic
   - Better: Simple statements of fact
   - "80% to you. 20% covers everything else."

4. **Dense Feature Lists**
   - Too much information at once
   - Bloom prefers breathing room
   - Better: Progressive disclosure, clean layouts

5. **"Transform Your Practice"**
   - Transformation is overused in wellness marketing
   - Bloom is about sustainability, not transformation
   - Better: "A Practice That Works" or "Room to Grow"

## ‚úÖ Bloom-Aligned Content Strategy

### Core Principles

1. **Lead with Simplicity**
   - One clear idea per section
   - Short paragraphs (2-3 lines max)
   - Lots of white space

2. **Use Natural Metaphors**
   - Growth, cultivation, roots, blooming
   - Gardens need care, practitioners need support
   - Organic vs. forced growth

3. **Show, Don't Tell**
   - "80% to you" (simple fact) vs. "generous industry-leading"
   - Numbers speak louder than adjectives
   - Let practitioners draw their own conclusions

4. **Focus on Removal, Not Addition**
   - "No paperwork" vs. "automated systems"
   - "No quotas" vs. "flexible scheduling"
   - Freedom through subtraction

5. **Community Over Competition**
   - "Join practitioners who..." vs. "Be the best"
   - Collaborative language
   - Shared success stories

### Founder Story

**Headline:**
```
Built by a Psychologist
```
*[Simple. "for psychologists" is implied]*

**Content (Tightened):**
```
Life Psychology Australia was founded by Dr. Zoe Semmler,
a clinical psychologist who saw talented practitioners leaving
the field‚Äînot because they didn't love the work, but because
the business side was unsustainable.

"I built this practice around one question: What if psychologists
could focus entirely on client care while earning what they deserve?"

Our 80% share isn't just generous‚Äîit's fair.
Our platform isn't just convenient‚Äîit removes barriers.
Our culture isn't just supportive‚Äîit's built on respect for balance.

A practice designed by someone who understands your work,
your challenges, and your worth.
```

*[Removed "truly" and other filler words, tightened paragraphs, maintained key quote]*

## üé® Final Copy Philosophy

**Bloom is:**
- Calm, not urgent
- Clear, not clever
- Human, not corporate
- Simple, not simplified
- Supportive, not pushy

**The page should feel like:**
- A deep breath
- A conversation with a trusted colleague
- An invitation, not a pitch
- Space to think, not pressure to act

**Success metric:**
When a psychologist reads this page, they should think:
"This feels like it was written by someone who gets it."

Not:
"Wow, what an amazing opportunity!" (too salesy)
