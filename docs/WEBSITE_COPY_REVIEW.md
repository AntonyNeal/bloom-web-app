Rebuilding after betrayal, managing jealousy, or working through past hurts

### Evidence-Based Approach (EFT Section)
```
Our psychologists draw on evidence-based approaches, including Emotionally 
Focused Therapy (EFT), one of the most researched and effective models 
for couples therapy.

Developed by Dr. Sue Johnson, EFT is grounded in attachment theory — the 
understanding that humans have an innate need for secure emotional bonds. 
When these bonds feel threatened, we often respond with patterns that can 
inadvertently push our partner away rather than draw them closer.

Research shows that 70-75% of couples move from distress to recovery through 
EFT, and approximately 90% show significant improvement. These outcomes have 
been replicated across diverse populations and relationship challenges.
```

**Review Notes:**
- [ ] **EXCELLENT:** Research-backed with specific statistics
- [ ] Accessible explanation of attachment theory ✅
- [ ] Professional yet relatable tone ✅
- [ ] **MINOR:** Consider linking to Dr. Sue Johnson or EFT resources (optional)
- [ ] Grammar/spelling check ✅

### Telehealth Setup Section

**Same Location:**
```
Most couples join sessions together from home. Find a private space 
where you won't be interrupted, and position yourselves so you're 
both visible on camera. A laptop or tablet on a table works well.
```

**Different Locations:**
```
If needed, partners can join from separate locations — useful for 
work travel, separated couples, or when one partner isn't yet 
comfortable sharing space during sessions.
```

**Review Notes:**
- [ ] Practical, actionable guidance ✅
- [ ] Non-judgmental about different scenarios ✅
- [ ] Clear technical requirements ✅
- [ ] Grammar/spelling check ✅

---

### FAQ Section

**Q: What if my partner won't come to couples therapy?**
```
While couples therapy works best with both partners present, individual 
therapy can still help you develop skills, gain clarity about your 
relationship, and work on your own patterns. Sometimes one partner 
starting therapy encourages the other to join later.
```

**Review Notes:**
- [ ] **EXCELLENT:** Addresses a major barrier to seeking help
- [ ] Offers alternative without pressuring ✅
- [ ] Hopeful but realistic tone ✅
- [ ] Grammar/spelling check ✅

---

**Q: When should couples consider therapy?**
```
Couples seek therapy for many reasons: communication difficulties, 
trust issues, life transitions, feeling disconnected, or simply 
wanting to strengthen their relationship. There's no "right time" 
— if you're thinking about it, that's often a good sign you're ready.
```

**Review Notes:**
- [ ] **EXCELLENT:** Normalizes seeking help before crisis
- [ ] Empowering framing ("good sign you're ready") ✅
- [ ] Grammar/spelling check ✅
