# Tier 2 Rose - Miyazaki-Inspired Redesign

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Objective:** Redesign the purple rose flower to better capture the essence of a real rose while maintaining Miyazaki's principle of "simplicity with soul"

## Analysis

### Real Rose (Reference Photo)
- 20-30+ layered petals spiraling inward
- Ruffled, organic edges
- Rich depth with multiple layers creating natural shadows
- Complex color gradation from light lavender to deep purple
- Soft, velvety texture
- Tightly clustered center (mostly hidden)
- Strong 3D volumetric presence

### Simple Illustration (Reference Graphic)
- 5 rounded petals in perfect circle
- High shine/highlight on each petal
- Flat, badge-like appearance
- Clear, prominent center
- Clean geometric simplicity

### Previous SVG Implementation
- 6 petals, single layer
- Elliptical shapes with gradients
- Visible golden center
- Minimal depth or layering
- **Issue:** Lacked the spiraling, layered quality of a real rose

## Miyazaki's Philosophy Applied

From studying Studio Ghibli flowers (*Howl's Moving Castle*, *The Secret World of Arrietty*, *When Marnie Was There*):

1. **Simplicity with Soul** - Not photorealistic, but capturing the *essence*
2. **Layered Depth** - Multiple petal rings suggesting complexity
3. **Organic Imperfection** - Asymmetry, varied sizes
4. **Soft, Hand-Drawn Quality** - Gentle curves over geometric perfection
5. **Emotional Resonance** - The flower should feel alive
6. **Strategic Detail** - More detail where it matters, less where it doesn't

## New Design Implementation

### Structure
- **Outer Ring:** 6 larger petals (lighter, more exposed to light)
- **Inner Ring:** 4 smaller petals (deeper color, spiraling inward)
- **Total:** 10 petals (balanced between complexity and performance)

### Color Gradients

**Outer Petals** (`purplePetalOuter`):
- Lighter tones: `#F0E5F9` â†’ `#E0CEF0` â†’ `#C7ABD9` â†’ `#B18FC7` â†’ `#9B72AA`
- Represents petals catching more light on the outside

**Inner Petals** (`purplePetalInner`):
- Deeper, more saturated: `#D4BEED` â†’ `#B18FC7` â†’ `#9B72AA` â†’ `#7A5589`
- Represents shadowed inner petals spiraling toward center

**Shadow** (`purpleShadow`):
- Deep purple shadows: `#6F4C7A` â†’ `#4A3350`
- Creates depth where petals overlap

**Center** (`roseCenterGradient`):
- Subtle golden tones: `#F5E6B8` â†’ `#E8D4A8` â†’ `#C9A87C`
- Mostly hidden (r=2.8), just peeking through inner petals

### Organic Variations

**Outer Petals:**
- Angle variations: `[5, -3, 4, -4, 3, -5]` degrees
- Size variations: `[1.05, 0.95, 1.0, 1.08, 0.98, 1.02]`
- Distance from center: 10.5 units
- Dimensions: ~6.5 Ã— 7.2 units (varied by size factor)

**Inner Petals:**
- Angle variations: `[4, -6, 5, -4]` degrees
- Size variations: `[0.88, 0.92, 0.85, 0.90]`
- Distance from center: 6.2 units (closer, more intimate)
- Dimensions: ~5.0 Ã— 5.8 units (smaller, creating spiral effect)
- Positioned at offsets: `[30, 100, 190, 280]` degrees (between outer petals)

### Highlights
- **Outer petals:** Brighter highlights (`rgba(255, 250, 255, 0.7)`) - catching light
- **Inner petals:** Softer highlights (`rgba(230, 215, 240, 0.65)`) - more subdued
- Positioned asymmetrically for hand-drawn feel

### Center Design
- Main circle: r=2.8 (reduced from 4.5) - mostly hidden by inner petals
- Detail circle: r=1.2 - hint of stamens
- Lower opacity (0.6, 0.4) - mysterious, not prominent

### Sparkle Updates
- Color changed from golden `#D9B380` to soft lavender `#C7ABD9`
- Matches the purple rose theme
- Maintains magical quality

## Performance Metrics

### SVG Element Count (Per Flower)
- **Previous:** 18 elements (6 petals Ã— 3 shapes each)
- **New:** 26 elements (6 outer Ã— 3 shapes + 4 inner Ã— 2 shapes + 2 center)
- **Increase:** +8 elements (+44%)
- **Trade-off:** Acceptable for significantly improved visual quality

### Build Results
- Bundle size: **386.72 kB** (121.45 kB gzipped)
- Build time: **7.64s**
- No performance degradation observed

## Visual Improvements

1. âœ¨ **Layered depth** - Inner and outer petal rings create spiraling effect
2. ðŸŒ¹ **More rose-like** - Closer to real rose structure without photorealism
3. ðŸŽ¨ **Richer color** - Dual gradients for light/shadow variation
4. ðŸŒ¿ **Organic feel** - Varied angles, sizes, and positions
5. ðŸ’« **Hidden center** - More mysterious and authentic to roses
6. âœ¨ **Cohesive sparkles** - Lavender sparkles match flower color

## Miyazaki Spirit Achieved

- **Simplicity:** Only 10 petals (vs. 20-30+ in real roses)
- **Soul:** Spiraling inner petals suggest depth and life
- **Imperfection:** Varied sizes and angles create organic, hand-drawn quality
- **Emotion:** The flower feels like it's gently blooming, alive
- **Balance:** Enough detail to be meaningful, not overwhelming

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/common/QualificationCheck.tsx`:
   - Updated `Tier2Flower` component
   - New gradient definitions
   - Dual petal ring implementation
   - Sparkle color update

## Next Steps
