# POST-DEPLOYMENT CASCADE WORKFLOW
# Automatically merges main into staging and develop after production deployment
#
# TRIGGER: Runs after successful deployment to main branch
# ACTIONS:
# 1. Merge main → staging (fast-forward if possible)
# 2. Merge main → develop (fast-forward if possible)
#
# This ensures all branches stay in sync after a production release

          This may indicate merge conflicts that need to be resolved before the next development cycle can begin."
